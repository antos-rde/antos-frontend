AntOS is a front-end API that mimics the traditional desktop environment on the web browser. The front-end can connect to a remote server and acts as a virtual desktop environment (VDE). The original purpose of AntOS is to provide visual tools to access and control resource on remote server
and embedded linux environment. With its application API and the provided SDK, AntOS facilitates the
development and deployment of user specific applications.

This repository contains only the front-end API. To have fully functional VDE, AntOS need to connect
to the corresponding server side API.
