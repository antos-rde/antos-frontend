# antos
Simple web os (client side) based on jQuery and Riot, it is designed to be used along with our antd server and Lua based server side app, but can be adapted to be used with any server side languages (PHP, etc) and server, by implementing all the system calls API defined in core/handlers/RemoteHandler.coffee. Basically, application design for the web os (packages/ or services/) relies on these system calls for communicating with the server. In doing so, the entire application can be developped with coffee/javascript/css without the need of a server side script.

Note that, the development of the project is in early alpha state, so bugs are very welcome :)
